Local meta-harness for harness-backed AI agents. Built on tmux, written in Rust.

> Forager lets people entrust meaningful work to agents and return to evidence,
> choices, and continuity instead of mystery.

Forager does not try to replace Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI,
Mistral Vibe, OpenHands, or local LLM scripts. It supervises harness-backed
agents with local approvals, durable runtime evidence, recovery state,
reviewable handoffs, and deliberate knowledge promotion.

Run multiple harness-backed agents in parallel across different branches of your
codebase, each in its own isolated session. Send bounded work Offdesk, return to
evidence, and hand the next step to a fresh harness without reconstructing state
from chat scrollback. `aoe` remains available as a legacy compatibility alias
while the project moves to `forager`.

> If you find this project useful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub: it helps others discover the project!

## Why Forager Exists

AI coding agents are getting stronger, but long-running agent work is still hard
to trust after the fact. Forager keeps the useful autonomy while making the
operational boundary explicit:

- **Entrust** meaningful work to a chosen harness-backed agent.
- **Observe** what actually ran through local state, tmux, heartbeat, progress,
  logs, and result artifacts.
- **Return** to evidence, risks, next choices, and reusable handoff packages.
- **Promote** only reviewed lessons into durable project knowledge.

## What Forager Owns

Hosted harnesses own their agent loops, prompts, model calls, tools, and
interaction style. Forager owns the local control plane around them:

- **Harness-backed agent support** -- Claude Code, OpenCode, Mistral Vibe,
  Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, local scripts, and future hosted harness agents
- **TUI dashboard** -- create, monitor, attach, recover, and review sessions
- **Agent + terminal views** -- toggle between AI agents and paired shell terminals with `t`
- **Status detection** -- see which agents are running, waiting for input, idle, stopped, or failed
- **Git worktrees** -- run parallel agents on different branches of the same repo
- **Diff view** -- review git changes without leaving the TUI
- **Per-repo config** -- `.forager/config.toml` for project-specific settings and hooks, with `.aoe/config.toml` fallback
- **Profiles** -- separate workspaces for different projects or clients
- **Offdesk recovery** -- durable task queueing, approval retry, lifecycle recovery, and audit trails
- **Ondesk/Offdesk handoff** -- project initialization, prompt packages,
  launch dry runs, runtime approvals, closeout packets, and wiki review
  surfaces for longer autonomous work
- **Reviewed knowledge** -- adaptive wiki candidates become reusable guidance
  only after explicit review and promotion
- **CLI and TUI** -- full functionality from both interfaces

## The Operating Loop

```text
observe current state
  -> prepare bounded work
  -> request approval
  -> run under durable local supervision
  -> collect evidence
  -> close out and review
  -> return to a fresh Ondesk harness
  -> promote durable knowledge deliberately
```

Forager wraps [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). Each session is a tmux session, so agents keep running when you close the TUI. Reopen `forager` and everything is still there.

The key tmux shortcut to know: **`Ctrl+b d`** detaches from a session and returns to the TUI.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) (required)

```bash
# Quick install (Linux & macOS)
curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimyoungjin06/forager-cli/main/scripts/install.sh \
  | bash

# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/kimyoungjin06/forager-cli
cd forager && cargo build --release
```

The install script and release artifacts now use `forager` as the primary
command and keep `aoe` as a legacy alias during the transition.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the TUI
forager

# Add a session from CLI
forager add /path/to/project

# Add a session on a new git branch
forager add . -w feat/my-feature -b

```

In the TUI: `n` to create a session, `Enter` to attach, `t` to toggle terminal view, `D` for diff view, `d` to delete, `?` for help.

## FAQ

### What happens when I close Forager?

Nothing. Sessions are tmux sessions running in the background. Open and close `forager` as often as you like. Sessions only get removed when you explicitly delete them.

### Which harness-backed agents are supported?

Claude Code, OpenCode, Mistral Vibe, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. Forager
auto-detects which are installed on your system.

## Troubleshooting

### Using Forager with mobile SSH clients (Termius, Blink, etc.)

Run `forager` inside a tmux session when connecting from mobile:

```bash
tmux new-session -s main
forager
```

Use `Ctrl+b L` to toggle back to Forager after attaching to an agent session.

### Claude Code is flickering

This is a known Claude Code issue, not a Forager problem: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1913

## Development

```bash
cargo check          # Type-check
cargo test           # Run tests
cargo fmt            # Format
cargo clippy         # Lint
cargo build --release  # Release build

# Debug logging
FORAGER_DEBUG=1 cargo run --bin forager
```
