# Project State

Updated: 2026-07-21

This is the small current surface for Forager development work. It is separate
from the public product README and from the mdBook user guides.

## Current Focus

Forager is a local autonomy meta-harness around tmux-supervised,
harness-backed agent work. The current development focus is the generic
Offdesk operating loop, mobile Remote Operator surfaces, runtime recovery,
documentation/artifact hygiene, and keeping domain-specific validation history
out of product-facing docs. The product direction is defined in
`docs/project-direction.md`.

## First Reads For Development

- repository rules: `AGENTS.md`
- project direction: `docs/project-direction.md`
- hosted harness contract: `docs/hosted-harness-agents.md`
- product overview: `README.md`
- remote operator contract: `docs/remote-operator.md`
- operation cycle: `docs/guides/operation-cycle.md`
- current offdesk status: `docs/offdesk-operation-status.md`
- UI surface TODO: `docs/ui-surface-todo.md`
- Web dashboard control-plane TODO:
  `docs/web-dashboard-control-plane-todo.md`
- runtime smoke runbook: `docs/guides/offdesk-runtime-smoke.md`
- long-run validation runbook: `docs/guides/offdesk-long-run-validation.md`
- adaptive wiki contract: `docs/adaptive-wiki.md`

## Active Documentation Work

- Public README, mdBook introduction, brand system, and Astro landing page lead
  with the north star and local meta-harness positioning.
- The committed TUI preview must stay profile-neutral. It should not show a
  project-specific profile, domain module, or private workspace name.
- `forager project audit-docs` provides the v1 audit for governance surfaces,
  deliverables, decision sources, current freshness, latest aliases, logs,
  adaptive wiki projection freshness, and focused recommendations.
- `forager offdesk closeout` carries documentation governance recommendations
  into `RETURN_PACKAGE.md`, so `ondesk prompt-package` can surface them without
  embedding the full audit summary.
- `forager project apply-governance-hints` is the reviewed bridge from packet
  hints into target project files. It dry-runs by default, creates only missing
  governance surfaces with `--reviewed`, and never overwrites existing docs.
- `forager offdesk wiki export-markdown` defaults to the active profile's
  `wiki-vault/` projection and reports whether the markdown vault is missing,
  stale, fresh, or empty relative to canonical adaptive wiki JSON state.
- `forager doctor` and `forager status --json` expose active profile/app
  directory source, making legacy AoE storage fallback visible before
  migration.
- Telegram Remote Operator health is live for the default profile. It reports a
  polling listener, configured chat allowlist, local model availability, and a
  read-only action surface. Remote launch remains blocked by design.
- The external Telegram Remote Operator watchdog can run outside the listener
  process, read loop-status and systemd state, send rate-limited emergency
  alerts, and render user-service/timer units through the installer.
- Domain-specific validation notes have been moved out of mdBook product docs
  into `archive/domain-history/`. They remain available for historical
  inspection but should not shape public product language.

## Current Gaps

- The Remote Operator can guide project selection, initialization preview,
  plan draft creation, plan registration, plan-review approval, and read-only
  launch-preparation packet creation. It can also create a pending
  `dispatch.runtime` gate request, resolve that exact approval, and write a
  bounded `ExecutionBrief`, a local-review enqueue handoff receipt, and a
  prepared-workload binding receipt. It can enqueue only the bound
  `dispatch.runtime` task, start it only through task-scoped tick, and monitor
  only that same task through task-scoped tick with `--limit 0`. It can create
  a closeout packet only for that completed monitored task, then write a local
  `closeout-review` handoff with verdict command templates. It can record only
  handoff-bound `approved`, `revise`, or `blocked` closeout-review verdicts
  from Telegram. Accepted truth is recorded only when the resulting
  `closeout_receipt.v1` status is `accepted`.
- Closeout follow-up decision resolution and accepted-truth recovery surfaces
  still need a separate design and implementation pass.
- The Telegram listener now survives known transport failures, and the external
  watchdog covers stale listener, failed service, and emergency alert paths.
- Website dependencies were refreshed to close `npm audit` findings; Astro 6,
  Tailwind 4, and an esbuild security override are now part of the verified
  site build path.
- UI surfaces now have a first shared operator-state contract, compact Telegram
  decision relay cards, semantic TUI Offdesk summaries, a fixture-backed WebUI
  review route, live `review_surface.v1` export/hydration for the WebUI route,
  Playwright desktop/mobile screenshot coverage, and a TUI preview summary.
- The long-term Web dashboard/control-plane direction is captured in
  `docs/web-dashboard-control-plane-todo.md`: workstation overview, project
  portfolio, decision inbox, scoped provenance graph, action envelope, and
  dashboard-aware assistant.
- The first Web dashboard slice is live: `forager ondesk workstation-surface
  --json`, `npm run export:workstation-surface`, and the static `/dashboard/`
  route now share `workstation_surface.v1`.
- The workstation dashboard now has fixture coverage for healthy idle, agent
  outage, active run, accepted closeout, and accepted-truth recovery states.
- The `/dashboard/` project portfolio now behaves as a selectable work queue:
  selecting a project shows a focused detail panel with plan/runtime/closeout/
  truth chips, decision/runtime/truth-recovery counts, and a project-specific
  next action derived from the existing `workstation_surface.v1`. The
  dashboard's Scoped Graph now follows the selected project and shows that
  project's plan/runtime/closeout/accepted-truth path plus local blockers. The
  read-only Assistant panel now follows the same selected project and exposes
  scoped prompts plus state or receipt refs before any future action-card work.
- The read-only Web decision action center is live: `workstation_surface.v1`
  now embeds `decision_inbox_surface.v1`, and `/decisions/` renders open
  decision records with allowed action previews, stale guards, authorization
  boundary, and CLI fallback.
- Decision action previews now carry `action_envelope.v1` cards with observed
  hashes, nonce/TTL, issued/expiry timestamps, idempotency keys, forbidden
  effects, confirmation phrases, expected receipt schema, and safe CLI
  inspection fallback. `forager ondesk action-envelope --envelope <PATH>
  --json` now validates those envelopes against the current decision ledger and
  writes idempotent `action_envelope_receipt.v1` acceptance or stale-rejection
  receipts. `workstation_surface.v1` now attaches matching latest receipt
  verdicts back onto action cards, and `/decisions/` renders those verdicts
  without exposing full logs. `forager ondesk action-preflight --receipt-id
  <ID> --json` now starts only from a validated action-envelope receipt,
  rejects stale or non-latest receipts, rechecks the current decision hash, and
  writes an idempotent `action_execution_preflight.v1` without mutating runtime
  or project state. `forager ondesk action-decision --preflight-id <ID>
  --note <TEXT> --json` is the first action-specific executor: it requires a
  ready preflight, supports only bounded decision choices, appends canonical
  decision handoff records, records idempotent `decision_action_execution.v1`
  receipts, and still does not dispatch runtime work or update accepted truth.
  `workstation_surface.v1` now attaches the latest matching
  `decision_action_execution.v1` result back onto decision action cards, and
  `/decisions/` renders applied/blocked execution summaries without exposing
  full execution logs. `forager ondesk action-closeout --execution-id <ID>
  --json` now closes an applied decision action handoff into a canonical
  `DecisionReceipt`, writes `decision_action_closeout.v1`, and keeps runtime
  dispatch/project-file/accepted-truth mutation out of this stage. The
  workstation surface projects the append-only decision ledger through the
  latest record per decision id, so receipted decisions no longer remain open
  through stale ledger entries. `forager ondesk runtime-preflight
  --closeout-id <ID> --json` now verifies a receipted closeout against the
  latest canonical decision receipt and writes `runtime_dispatch_preflight.v1`.
  `forager ondesk runtime-dispatch --preflight-id <ID> --runner <RUNNER>
  --cmd <CMD> --json` queues a durable `OffdeskTask` and records
  `runtime_dispatch_receipt.v1`; it does not launch a process, so actual
  runtime execution still passes through `forager offdesk tick` and the
  scheduler gate. `workstation_surface.v1` now exposes a separate
  `runtime_dispatch_surface.v1` for receipted post-closeout handoffs, and
  `/decisions/` renders preflight, queue-dispatch, and tick CLI fallbacks
  without re-opening the decision inbox. The workstation surface also exposes
  `accepted_truth_recovery_surface.v1` for latest closeout receipts that are
  not accepted truth, and `/dashboard/` renders those follow-up, blocked, or
  retired-incomplete states with short local CLI fallback commands plus
  receipt-backed `accepted_truth_recovery_action_envelope.v1` previews. The
  matching `forager ondesk accepted-truth-recovery-envelope --envelope <PATH>
  --json` command writes only
  `accepted_truth_recovery_action_receipt.v1` validation/stale receipts and
  never executes the fallback or records accepted truth.
- Large Offdesk and Telegram adapter modules need staged decomposition before
  adding more mutation-capable remote actions.
- The 2026-06-26 refactor baseline is captured in
  `docs/refactor-baseline-20260626.md`. The mutation-freeze has been lifted by
  product decision to widen the Telegram operator surface, but new remote
  execution must reuse the existing receipt-gated CLI executors rather than
  add new mutation logic, and must land in the new `scripts/telegram_operator/`
  modules instead of the monolith.
- Telegram now has a guarded remote execution surface in
  `scripts/telegram_operator/dispatch.py`: `/decisions` lists open decisions,
  `/decision <id> <action> [note]` returns a single-use confirmation token
  bound to the target's observed hash with a TTL, and `/confirm <token>`
  runs the existing `action-envelope` -> `action-preflight` ->
  `action-decision` -> `action-closeout` chain after re-checking the hash.
  `/recovery` and `/recover <closeout-id> <action> [note]` mirror this for
  accepted-truth recovery follow-ups; `/confirm` on a recovery token runs
  `accepted-truth-recovery-envelope`, which validates and records a receipt but
  stops short of recording accepted truth. `/cancel` clears a pending
  confirmation. It never records accepted truth.
- The Telegram adapter decomposition is complete: the monolith dropped from
  ~7,367 to ~1,885 lines (CLI entrypoint, run loop, projection commands,
  dispatch wiring, feedback ingest). Health, redaction, plan-message
  renderers, schemas, stage receipt builders, shared result plumbing
  (`base.py`), and the plan-session state machine (`plan_workflow.py`) are now
  separate, acyclic modules under `scripts/telegram_operator/`.
- Runtime dispatch is available but opt-in: `/runtime` lists post-closeout
  handoffs and `/dispatch <closeout-id> <runner> -- <command>` queues an
  operator-supplied command, gated behind `--enable-runtime-dispatch`
  (default off; this is remote command execution). On `/confirm`,
  `runtime-preflight` re-verifies the closeout and `runtime-dispatch` queues a
  durable task that runs only through `forager offdesk tick`.
- Telegram has one-look triage: `/attention` reads the workstation surface and
  returns a single card aggregating open decisions, recovery follow-ups, and
  review-flagged tasks, with per-category counts and the single most urgent
  action first. Read-only; logic in `attention_summary`
  (`scripts/telegram_operator/notifier.py`).
- Telegram confirmation cards carry one-tap `확인`/`취소` buttons: `확인` sends a
  bare `/confirm` that confirms the single pending confirmation for the chat, so
  the operator never types the token. `/attention` also offers the top action as
  a one-tap button. The `/decisions` card renders the top open decision's action
  kinds as full `/decision <id> <action>` buttons, so a decision is handled in
  two taps (action, then `확인`). This completes the urgent-handling roadmap
  (notify -> triage -> act -> stop), now fully tap-driven.
- The Telegram poller can proactively notify: with `--attention-notify` (the
  systemd installer enables it by default) each poll scans the workstation
  surface and pushes the owner chat a deduplicated card for newly waiting
  decisions and recovery follow-ups, naming the exact command to run. The scan
  is read-only and never crashes the loop. This closes the biggest gap for
  urgent handling: the operator is told when to act instead of having to poll
  `/decisions` manually. Logic lives in
  `scripts/telegram_operator/notifier.py`.
- Telegram has an emergency stop: `/tasks` lists cancellable tasks and
  `/cancel-task <task-id> [reason]` -> `/confirm` marks a durable task
  cancelled (fail-safe; available without the runtime-dispatch opt-in). It does
  not kill an already-running background process, which the result card states
  plainly.
- Telegram has a global emergency pause: `/pause [reason]` is immediate and
  engages a persistent operator pause (`offdesk_operator_pause.json`) so
  `forager offdesk tick` holds all new dispatch (queued tasks stay queued,
  reported as `held`) while still polling existing runs. `/resume` is
  confirm-gated and clears the pause. Backed by `src/offdesk/operator_pause.rs`
  and the `forager offdesk pause`/`unpause`/`pause-status` CLI. This completes
  the emergency-stop slice of the urgent-handling roadmap (notify -> triage ->
  act -> stop).

- Telegram has a curated dispatch allowlist: `/run` lets the operator dispatch a
  named, pre-vetted command template without the free-form
  `--enable-runtime-dispatch`. Templates live in a local JSON file
  (`--dispatch-allowlist-file`); the operator only names one, and the command is
  re-resolved from the current allowlist at confirm time (removing a template
  revokes it even for an outstanding confirmation). This is the safer alternative
  to free-form `/dispatch`. Logic in `scripts/telegram_operator/allowlist.py`.

- Offdesk has event-driven learning signals (Hermes pattern #9): each denied
  approval, failed runtime task, and resume-pending recovery row emits an
  adaptive-wiki *candidate* (recommendation-only, redacted, `runtime_observed`).
  A durable cursor (`learning_signals_state.json`) emits each event once while
  the candidate store merges by claim so repeated patterns accrue
  `occurrence_count`. `run_offdesk_tick` runs the scan automatically (reports
  `learning_signals_emitted`, never fails the tick) and
  `forager offdesk learning-scan [--json]` runs it on demand. No auto-promotion;
  candidates still require the existing reviewed promotion path. Logic in
  `src/offdesk/learning_signals.rs`.

- The adaptive-wiki knowledge graph now has a servable web visualization: the
  `/knowledge` route (`website/src/pages/knowledge.astro`) renders the tag graph
  with Plotly (`plotly.js-dist-min`) as a clustered network -- records
  (promoted/candidate/deprecated) grouped into regions by tag prefix, derived
  structural edges hidden by default, hover detail, read-only/advisory. Data is
  plugged in via `npm run export:wiki-graph` (`website/scripts/export-wiki-graph.mjs`
  runs `forager offdesk wiki graph --json`, enriches nodes with
  status/kind/scope/occurrence, writes the gitignored `public/wiki-graph.json`);
  the route builds from the committed `src/data/wiki-graph.sample.json` fixture and
  hydrates from the live export at runtime, mirroring the workstation-surface
  pattern. Note: bundling Plotly adds a large (~4.8 MB) JS chunk scoped to the
  `/knowledge` page only.
- `/knowledge` is multi-view along two axes: a **profile** selector (tenant; from
  a `public/wiki-graph/index.json` manifest written by `--profiles`) and a
  **facet** filter (research vs ops) sliced within a profile. Facet is derived
  per record in the export (`facet/*` tag wins; else research modes ->research,
  development/maintenance ->ops, governance tags ->ops). `?profile=&facet=`
  deep-link the view. This realizes the "knowledge planes" model: a project's
  research knowledge and its operational (harness-use) knowledge separate by
  facet, while Forager's own operating knowledge is intended to live in a
  dedicated `forager-ops` profile (not yet stood up). Astro dev/preview bind to
  all interfaces (`server.host`/`preview.host`) for remote access.
- Operators can author knowledge directly (e.g. from a doc review) with
  `forager offdesk wiki record-candidate --kind --scope --scope-ref --claim ...`
  which records a governed candidate (origin `operator_explicit`, signal
  `imported_doc`) via the existing `record_candidate` path; promotion stays a
  separate reviewed step. This filled the missing capture primitive (previously
  candidates came only from `/remember`, overnight ingest, or learning-signals).
  Used to seed the TwinPaper wiki from `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` (5 -> 13 entries).
- Continuous doc distillation is live: `scripts/offdesk_wiki_distiller.py`
  sends a project document plus the distillation rubric to a local
  Ollama-compatible model, verifies every candidate's evidence quote verbatim
  against the source (fabricated provenance is rejected mechanically), and with
  `--record` writes survivors as unpromoted candidates
  (`origin=background_review`, `confidence=inferred`) via `record-candidate
  --origin`. Dry-run by default; never promotes. Chat-log and session-transcript
  distillation are planned follow-ups behind the same evidence/redaction
  boundary.
- Session retrospective distillation closes the mistake-prevention loop:
  `scripts/offdesk_wiki_session_distiller.py` extracts operator corrections,
  boundaries, and preferences from a local session transcript with a local LLM,
  verifies each lesson's operator quote verbatim against the real messages,
  filters injected prompts, and records survivors as unpromoted candidates
  (failure patterns carry `signal_kind=operator_correction`, feeding correction
  records and `evaluate-recurrence`). Benchmarked against Hermes source: Hermes
  has no automatic correction extraction (model-in-the-loop memory tool only),
  so this is a deliberate divergence, not an adoption. `record-candidate` gains
  `--signal-kind`.
- Entries are editable in place: `forager offdesk wiki edit <id> [--claim]
  [--ai-instruction] [--human-summary] [--evidence-ref]...` and
  `forager offdesk wiki add-tag <id> [--core-tag]... [--proposed-tag]...`. This
  lets a reviewer's compress / evidence-fix / retag verdicts apply without
  reject + re-record; each appends an audit record (`edit` / `retag`). The
  doc->distillation contract and review rubric live in
  `docs/adaptive-wiki-distillation.md`, validated by an A/B test (18-40% less
  projected context) and an independent reviewing-agent pass.

- Commute autonomy (퇴근→출근) is wired end-to-end: idle-watch in the Telegram
  listener proposes arming a bounded overnight window (one confirm card;
  operator tap is the only approval; backoff + quiet-hours + pause/pending
  suppression), `offdesk_autonomy_run.py` manages the armed state
  (auto-expiring, /pause-independent), and three armed-gated systemd timers
  run the night: tick heartbeat every 10 min, nightly distillation playbook
  at 02:00, morning brief at 08:50 which then disarms. Timers are installed
  by `install_offdesk_autonomy_timers.py` and are inert unless armed. Expired
  pending confirmations are cleared by the proposal scan instead of blocking
  future proposals.

- Telegram freeform chat is grounded: every plain-text message hands the local
  chat agent an `operator_snapshot` (workstation surface summary, health,
  open decisions, workspace project folder hints, autonomy state) plus the
  complete `supported_commands` surface from `routing.py::COMMAND_SURFACE`,
  and `scrub_unknown_commands()` rewrites hallucinated slash commands to
  `/help`. Before this the agent answered state questions with "cannot check"
  and invented commands like `/list` and `/projects` that bounced as
  unsupported.

## Next Work Candidates

0. Apply the deferred council verdicts once a kind/agent-mode edit primitive
   exists (`wiki edit` covers text/evidence only): reclassify
   telegram-guarded-execution and offdesk-tick entries (forager-ops),
   direction-review entry (twinpaper-review, procedure->policy_rule), and fix
   agent-mode projection on migrations (drop maintenance), tick (universal),
   and figure-anchors (+analysis).

1. Fix harvest-pipeline defects found by the first tier-3 pass: the
   prereview quote fallback turns missing quotes into unverifiable
   "pointer quotes" (should mark unclear instead), review_reason truncation
   can cut the stored quote, and the session distiller fans one quote into
   many near-duplicate claims (needs a per-quote cap). Also spot-check
   prereview-"supported" items for quote-claim mismatch.
2. Extend learning signals to the remaining lifecycle events (pre-compression
   extraction, wiki projection usage) and add a curator-style staleness report
   (Hermes patterns #9 follow-up and #10).
2. Split the large Offdesk CLI (`src/cli/offdesk.rs`, ~18k lines) into command
   handling and typed workflow transition modules, applying the same
   extraction pattern proven on the Telegram adapter.
3. Optionally split `scripts/telegram_operator/receipts.py` (~1,960 lines) by
   stage family if it keeps growing; it is cohesive today.
4. Optionally add parameterized `/run` templates (constrained argument
   substitution) if fixed commands prove too rigid; keep injection surface in
   mind.

## Refresh Rule

Refresh this file when the active development focus changes, a new governance
surface is added, or the next contributor would otherwise need to infer current
state from multiple long-form status documents.
