# Offdesk Operation Status

This page records the current Forager Offdesk operating baseline and the work
that remains before treating the system as a dependable overnight operator.

Snapshot date: 2026-06-17.

## Current Baseline

Forager now has a generic Offdesk operating loop, a read-only Remote Operator
projection surface, a Telegram transport adapter, project initialization
packets, plan registration/review records, runtime approval gates, background
runner probes, closeout packets, Ondesk return packages, and adaptive wiki
review surfaces.

At this point:

- the default Forager profile is loaded from primary Forager storage;
- the default profile has no pending approvals, queued tasks, active tasks,
  failed tasks, resume-pending tasks, stale background runs, or
  closeout-required tasks;
- the Telegram listener is installed as a user service and reports healthy
  polling state through `scripts/offdesk_remote_operator_telegram.py --health`;
- the Telegram listener can survive known Telegram transport failures and
  record them as loop state instead of exiting;
- `scripts/offdesk_remote_operator_watchdog.py` runs outside the listener,
  reads the loop-status file and systemd service state, and sends rate-limited
  emergency Telegram alerts when remote operation is not currently reliable;
- the local model endpoint configured for the Remote Operator is available;
- Telegram can start and monitor only a reviewed, bound task through
  task-scoped `offdesk tick`, and can create a closeout packet only for that
  completed task; closeout review, accepted truth, arbitrary launch, and shell
  actions remain blocked from Telegram by design;
- `cargo test`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`,
  `mdbook build`, and the website build pass locally.

This baseline proves that the approval-gated runtime path and the remote
operator status path can be inspected consistently. It still does not prove
that every long autonomous run will produce useful project output.

## Verified Generic Flow

The intended flow is:

```text
project init
  -> implementation or plan packet
  -> plan dry run
  -> plan registration
  -> plan review
  -> launch-preparation packet
  -> enqueue dispatch.runtime task
  -> tick creates operator approval
  -> offdesk ok <approval-id>
  -> tick launches supervised runner
  -> poll reconciles heartbeat, log, and result artifacts
  -> closeout packet
  -> closeout review
  -> Ondesk return package
```

The Telegram Remote Operator currently covers the planning and narrowly scoped
runtime-start side of this flow:

- read-only `/status`, `/pending`, `/plans`, and `/show`;
- freeform planning request capture;
- project candidate selection;
- project initialization preview;
- project initialization packet creation;
- bounded plan draft creation;
- plan registration;
- explicit plan-review approval;
- read-only launch-preparation packet creation;
- pending gate request creation for local approval;
- exact pending gate approval resolution;
- bounded execution-brief generation;
- reviewed workload binding;
- bound enqueue run;
- task-scoped runtime start;
- task-scoped runtime monitor/readout;
- completed-task closeout packet creation.

It intentionally does not cover broad runtime launch, closeout review, or
accepted-truth review. Runtime dispatch still belongs to the local
enqueue/launch/tick path, and Telegram can only start the one reviewed task that
was already bound and queued, then poll/read and closeout-packet that same
completed task.

Remote Operator phase status:

| Phase | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only status and pending/plans/show | Implemented | No approvals are resolved. |
| Freeform planning request and project selection | Implemented | Creates planning/session evidence only. |
| Project init preview/run | Implemented | Creates local project operation packets; no runtime work. |
| Plan draft and registration | Implemented | Writes/dry-runs local plan artifacts only. |
| Explicit plan-review approval | Implemented | Records plan review; does not authorize launch. |
| Launch-preparation packet | Implemented | Creates `offdesk_plan_launch_prep.v1`; no gate approval. |
| Gate request | Implemented | Creates pending `dispatch.runtime` approval; does not resolve it. |
| Gate approval resolution | Implemented | Resolves exact matching approval; does not enqueue or launch. |
| Execution brief | Implemented | Writes bounded brief for local enqueue; does not enqueue or launch. |
| Enqueue handoff | Implemented | Writes a local-review command template only; does not enqueue or launch. |
| Workload binding | Implemented | Verifies and binds reviewed `prepared_task.json`; does not enqueue or launch. |
| Enqueue run | Implemented | Runs only bound `offdesk enqueue`; does not launch or tick. |
| Runtime start | Implemented | Runs only task-scoped `offdesk tick`; does not monitor or close out. |
| Runtime monitor/readout | Implemented | Polls only the same task with `offdesk tick --limit 0`; does not dispatch or close out. |
| Closeout packet | Implemented | Generates closeout artifacts only for the completed monitored task; does not review or accept truth. |
| Closeout review handoff | Implemented | Writes local `closeout-review` verdict templates; does not execute verdicts or accept truth. |
| Closeout verdict/accepted-truth bridge | Implemented | Runs only handoff-bound `closeout-review` verdicts; accepted truth follows the CLI receipt. |
| Listener health and external watchdog | Implemented | Reports or alerts; does not mutate Offdesk state. |

## Completed Work

### Runtime Safety

- Provider fallback is approval-gated and does not consume
  `dispatch.runtime` approvals.
- Runtime tasks require scoped `dispatch.runtime` approval before launch.
- Long Python workloads should use `local-tmux` when they need live inspection.
- System-critical operations remain forbidden unless a separate reviewed
  capability and approval path exists.
- Pre-mutation snapshots and dry-run restore plans keep rollback reasoning
  separate from execution.

### Project And Module Scope

- `forager project init` creates read-only project operation packets.
- Project initialization can identify module candidates and selected operation
  targets without mutating the target project.
- `MODULE_OPERATION_PREFLIGHT.json` is a reviewed preflight reference, not a
  hidden runtime permission grant.
- Ondesk prompt packages include concise project/module summaries when matching
  initialization artifacts exist.

### Remote Operator

- Remote projections are read-only and operator-safe.
- Telegram messages are compact enough for mobile scanning and keep detailed
  diagnostics in local health output.
- Telegram freeform messages can become reviewable decision-inbox items or
  planning sessions.
- Telegram can guide project selection, initialization preview/run, plan draft,
  plan registration, explicit plan-review approval, and read-only
  launch-preparation packet creation without launching work.
- Telegram can create a pending `dispatch.runtime` gate approval request from
  a launch-preparation packet without enqueueing or launching work.
- Telegram can approve or deny the exact pending gate approval it created, but
  cannot enqueue, launch, tick, or mark runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can write an `ExecutionBrief` for the exact approved gate context,
  but cannot enqueue, launch, tick, or mark runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can write an enqueue handoff receipt with a local-review command
  template, but cannot enqueue, launch, tick, or mark runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can bind a reviewed `prepared_task.json` to the approved execution
  brief after checking exact project/request/task and brief hash, but cannot
  enqueue, launch, tick, or mark runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can enqueue only the bound `dispatch.runtime` task after rechecking
  prepared workload and execution brief hashes, but cannot launch, tick, or mark
  runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can start only the bound queued task through task-scoped tick after
  rechecking prepared workload and execution brief hashes, but cannot close
  out or mark runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can monitor only the started task through task-scoped tick with
  `--limit 0`, but cannot dispatch, close out, or mark runtime work accepted.
- Telegram can create closeout artifacts only after the task-scoped monitor
  shows `completed`, but cannot review closeout, mutate files, or mark runtime
  work accepted.
- Telegram transport errors, send failures, and unexpected loop exceptions are
  recorded as health state with backoff.
- The user service uses restart-friendly systemd settings.
- The external watchdog reads loop-status and systemd state from outside the
  listener process and sends rate-limited emergency alerts when remote
  operation is not reliable.

### Adaptive Wiki And Return Boundary

- Offdesk may create wiki candidates or run-local trial entries.
- Canonical wiki promotion remains review-gated.
- Closeout and Ondesk return are required lifecycle stages for completed
  runtime work.
- `forager offdesk wiki export-markdown` defaults to the active profile's
  `wiki-vault/` directory and reports projection freshness.

### Documentation And Artifact Governance

- `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `DELIVERABLES.md` define the shallow
  current surfaces for the Forager checkout.
- `forager project audit-docs` audits current-state freshness, decision and
  deliverable surfaces, human-facing output candidates, large logs, latest
  aliases, and adaptive wiki markdown projection freshness.
- `forager project apply-governance-hints` is dry-run by default, requires
  `--reviewed` to write, creates only missing governance surfaces, and never
  overwrites existing project documents.
- `forager offdesk closeout` carries focused documentation-governance
  recommendations into the Ondesk return package.
- Domain-specific validation history is retained under `archive/domain-history/`
  instead of being presented as product documentation.

## Remaining Work

### 1. Closeout Review And Accepted-Truth Bridge

Goal: connect generated closeout packets to closeout review without
collapsing plan approval, gate request creation, approval resolution, brief
generation, enqueue, runtime start, runtime monitoring, closeout packet
generation, and accepted-truth review.

Acceptance checks:

- `forager offdesk enqueue`, `launch`, and `tick` remain separate runtime
  surfaces;
- Telegram cannot convert a plan-review approval, gate request, or gate
  approval into execution by itself;
- Telegram enqueue handoff stays a review receipt until a reviewed workload
  packet is bound;
- Telegram workload binding only produces `bound_enqueue_args` for local
  review; it must not run `forager offdesk enqueue` itself;
- Telegram enqueue run can queue only the bound task and must not call launch or
  tick;
- Telegram runtime start can call only task-scoped
  `offdesk tick --project-key --task-id --limit 1` and must not close out or
  accept runtime work;
- Telegram runtime monitor can call only task-scoped
  `offdesk tick --project-key --task-id --limit 0` and read the same task; it
  must not dispatch, close out, or accept runtime work;
- Telegram closeout packet can call only
  `offdesk closeout --project-key --task-id --dry-run --json`; it must not run
  closeout review, mutate files, or accept runtime work;
- Telegram closeout review handoff can write local `closeout-review` command
  templates only; it must not execute `closeout-review`, mutate files, or
  accept runtime work;
- Telegram closeout verdict recording can run only handoff-bound
  `closeout-review --verdict approved|revise|blocked`; accepted truth is
  recorded only when the resulting closeout receipt status is `accepted`;
- stale plan, stale review, changed launch packet, or mismatched approval
  blocks progression.

### 2. Accepted-Truth Review Bridge

Goal: expose closeout readiness and accepted-truth decisions through compact
operator surfaces.

Acceptance checks:

- mobile surfaces show heartbeat, blocker, and next-safe-action summaries;
- closeout artifacts are linked through CLI-inspectable receipts;
- completed execution remains separate from accepted truth;
- review-required states do not disappear from status.

### 3. Documentation And Dependency Hygiene

Goal: keep product docs current and release-clean.

Acceptance checks:

- `docs/**` contains no project-specific validation names in product surfaces;
- committed screenshots are profile-neutral;
- CLI reference is regenerated when command surfaces change;
- website dependencies are refreshed and `npm audit` is reviewed.

### 4. Module Decomposition

Goal: reduce regression risk before adding more remote actions.

Acceptance checks:

- Offdesk CLI plan/closeout/remote-operator code is split into smaller modules;
- Telegram adapter session, rendering, provider, and loop code are separated;
- existing integration tests continue to cover the public contracts.
