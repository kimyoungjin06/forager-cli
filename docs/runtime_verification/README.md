# Runtime Verification Artifacts

## Purpose
- This directory stores execution-ready and execution-result artifacts for live runtime verification.
- The governing contracts are:
  - `docs/LIVE_RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_SPEC.md`
  - `docs/LIVE_RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_SCENARIOS.md`

## Layout
- `phase2/TEMPLATE.md`
  - common capture template
- `phase2/build/`
- `phase2/data/`
- `phase2/review/`
- `phase2/mixed/`

## Current First Wave
- happy-path scenario stubs are prepared for:
  - `build/B1_happy_path.md`
  - `data/D1_happy_path.md`
  - `review/R1_happy_path.md`
  - `mixed/M1_happy_path.md`
- current execution status:
  - `build/B1_happy_path.md`
    - `executed_blocked`
    - finding:
      - `build` preset Phase2 lane graph drift blocked the happy path at planning gate
      - visible project registration later exposed task lineage surface drift
  - `data/D1_happy_path.md`
    - `planned`
  - `review/R1_happy_path.md`
    - `planned`
  - `mixed/M1_happy_path.md`
    - `planned`

## Rule
- Do not replace these artifacts with summaries detached from runtime evidence.
- Each scenario file should record:
  - expected contract
  - actual runtime evidence
  - operator surface evidence
  - mismatch and next fix
